## Motivation 

After Stephen Grider's react tutorial and this 
youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iWstfXntcj8f-dFZ4UtlN3

I decided to make a project which includes Redux and Back-end functions with Firebase.

## Key features

- Fully CRUD function. ( Update function will be updated soon. )

- Football Data API Call (https://www.football-data.org)

- Auth, Database, Storage, Hosting and Cloud Functions with Firebase
